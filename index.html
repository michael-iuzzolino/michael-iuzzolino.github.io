      Hi! I'm a machine learning researcher with the
      <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/applied-sciences-group/' target='_blank'>Applied Science Group</a> at Microsoft.
      I'm living in Bellevue, WA, but I am a PhD student in Computer Science at CU Boulder; my advisor is <a href='http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php' target='_blank'>Michael C. Mozer</a>.
      Our most recent work was focused on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03504' target='_blank'>convolutional attractor networks</a>. My undergrad was at the University of Arizona, where I completed a triple major in applied mathematics, neuroscience & cognitive science, and molecular & cellular biology.
      A fun aside: I've traveled ~35 countries, including long-distance solo trekking in the Andes and the Himalayas.

  <!-- I meant to be a writer. But in my study of the humanities, the fundamental
  questions about human nature, the natural world and our place in it recurred.
  I realized, such ponderings were incomplete without the scientific perspective.
  I was drawn to the biological, specifically the neuroscientific,
  angle which gratifyingly explains the physical bases and dynamics of complex
  animal behaviors.  -->

  <!-- At the moment, I am a graduate student in the
  Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program at the University
  of Colorado Boulder. The diversity of biological systems
  necessitates a wide gamut of questions and techniques. I have been
  exploring and venturing outside my comfort zone and I look forward to delving
  into the novel and fascinating perspectives that may await.

  <!-- I especially adore insects, especially the social superorganisms whose
  swarm intelligence is legendary. I hope to study this small world via various
  perspectives, including ecological, molecular, and systems modeling. -->
  <!-- I especially admire social insects. Their swarm intelligence is legendary.
  I have explored the ant world via a neuroethological perspective.  -->
