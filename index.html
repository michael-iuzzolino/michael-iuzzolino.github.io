  <!-- I meant to be a writer. But in my study of the humanities, the fundamental
  questions about human nature, the natural world and our place in it recurred.
  I realized, such ponderings were incomplete without the scientific perspective.
  I was drawn to the biological, specifically the neuroscientific,
  angle which gratifyingly explains the physical bases and dynamics of complex
  animal behaviors.  -->

  <!-- At the moment, I am a graduate student in the
  Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program at the University
  of Colorado Boulder. The diversity of biological systems
  necessitates a wide gamut of questions and techniques. I have been
  exploring and venturing outside my comfort zone and I look forward to delving
  into the novel and fascinating perspectives that may await.

  <!-- I especially adore insects, especially the social superorganisms whose
  swarm intelligence is legendary. I hope to study this small world via various
  perspectives, including ecological, molecular, and systems modeling. -->
  <!-- I especially admire social insects. Their swarm intelligence is legendary.
  I have explored the ant world via a neuroethological perspective.  -->

	<h3> Some favorite thoughts</h3>
	<blockquote>
    All the worldâ€™s a stage, <br>
    And all the men and women merely players; <br>
    ... <br>
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. <br>
    (William Shakespeare, As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII)
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:<br>
  "All right, then, I'll go to hell"- and tore it up. <br>
  (Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn)
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  For me, it is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to
  persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring. <br>
  (Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World)
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should
    expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and
    no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference. DNA neither
    knows nor cares. DNA just is. And we dance to its music. <br>
    (Richard Dawkins, River out of Eden)
  </blockquote>
